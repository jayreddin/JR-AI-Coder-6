I want you to review the puter-usage.md file, then I want you to review the index.html styles.css and script.js files: Don't act yet, when finished let me know for further instructions



style usage meter bar - centred and auto sizes to header width, have the used and total usage text on same row as usage bar one left hand side and one right hand side. add a % text label in the Usage bar. Give me the full updated code files.



review the attached poll-api.md file and plan/implement this:



add a settings icon image button to app header, when pressed a pop up will appear with settings, add a drop down menu called - Provider - when clicked the following options appear: Puter, Pollinations, Google, Github, OpenRouter and Custom Provider.



We will implement Google, Github, OpenRouter and Custom Provider later so user placeholders.

For Puter when selected show below the users username, saved apps in dev centre, sign in or sign out buttons if applicable.

For Pollinations when selected show below an API Key input box, show key, save key and test key buttons, when a key is saved show a models drop down menu with models available fetched from pollinations.



When a provider is selected and saved in settings make this the active app provider - show provider name label as user indicator in main UI header, change/use/display available providers models in the model drop down menu and use active provider api, always deploy to puter/ user sign in.



In settings allow user to favourite provider models and when saved show a new favourites section to top of drop down menu.



Any questions?



-----------------



In settings add a new tab a user can click to show a different settings page: 1st AI, 2nd UI.
